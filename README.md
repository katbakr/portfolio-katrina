# portfolio-katrina

## Description
A portfolio that will give basic information about me, display my projects, and offer contact information. This will be used to attract employment opportunities and to give some information about projects I've worked on. I built this project as a way to put and introduction, a list opf my projects, and contact information all in the same place while displaying my HTML and CSS compitencies. In this project I learned how to get more comfortable using flex box objects and unique styling in my applications through working on this challenge

## Usage

The options on the header bar will take the user to the different sections of this application. The links inside of the "Contact Me" section will allow users to choose from different methods to contact me and the links in those will allow the user to start that contact (call, email, or GitHub).
